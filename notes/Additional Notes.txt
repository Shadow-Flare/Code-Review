THOUGHTS:
	-	The asteroids have a good parent hierarchy, but we can go further.  We reall want to make use
		of polymorphism!
		-	For example, both the player and the asteroids wrap around the screen and move using the same speed variables.
			Perhaps they should share a single entity parent?
			
	- Player state machine may need to be changed down the road, depends on the plans
		-Invuln would be changed to a state instead of a flag if we add more states like being stunned or a dead state
		
		
	- Good use of future planning by creating scr_save now.

CHANGELOG:
	- I have removed the par_asteroid instance from the room.  Abstract parent objects should never be instantiated.
	- Replaced asteroid rotation code to use angle_difference
