/*  This script takes 3 arguments and returns the appropriate angle to aim in order to intercept a target.
    
    By calculating the time it will take to intercept the target instance based on it's current speed and
    direction, plus the speed of the intercepting instance (eg. a bullet), the script can determine the
    future position of the target at the time of interception and thus return the angle to that position.
    The script also has the option to do a faster approximation rather than the full calculation which
    would give a similar result at close range with less work.
    
    Arguments:
        0 = Speed of the intercepting object in pixels/step
        1 = Instance ID to intercept
        2 = Boolean indicating whether to do the full calculation (true) or a faster approximation (false)
    
    This script must be called in the END STEP event as it uses the xprevious and yprevious variables. */
